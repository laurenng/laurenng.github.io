                            <p>Hi! I'm Lauren Ng, a 4th year student studying Informatics with Honors. I am 
                                an outgoing, curious, and passionate student. I am very engaged with the 
                                Informatics Program by being a peer advisor, mentor, and program assistant. I 
                                also participate in Husky Taekwondo, Dubstech, and work at the Foster Business 
                                School. Everyday from 8am to 10pm, I live, breath, and study at UW. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>But coming into college, I was the complete opposite. I was a quiet and reclusive 
                                Husky. I mearly attended class, did my work in isolation, and spent the majority
                                of my day in my dorm. Luckily, I had the support of my Husky community to bring
                                me out of this shell and transform my into the person I am today! 
                                The husky spirit is contagious and I believe it has changed me for the better. </p>

                            <p>As mentioned in my introduction, I was never the one to take initiative and do something
                               when things were wrong. The only thing that I had going for me was a handful of upperclassmen 
                               mentors I was assigned to from a few RSOs. (Shout out to SWE, HuskyTech, and a2f) 
                           </p>
                           <br>
                           <p>
                               Through invitations to events, encouragement to speak up, and sharing various opportunities, 
                               I slowly grew my confidence and satisfaction in my college career.  These mentors really took 
                               me under their wings and encouraged me to be involved and make something of myself. They showed 
                               me what it meant to be a husky and changed my outlook on my college experience. 
                           </p>

                            <p>

                                The first opportunity I was blessed with was a really interesting research opportunity with 
                                the Informatics program in studying the experiences of Asian and Pacific Islander female 
                                students in programming courses. Here, I was placed in a small group to discuss research 
                                papers and helped a pHD student with her research. I helped write questions, recruit interviewees, 
                                conduct interviews, and write a paper on our findings. In doing this research, we discovered a 
                                large majority of female students feeling a sense of not belonging thus being less motivated to 
                                succeed. This research opened my mind and gave me more insights into this area of research.  It 
                                made me realize how big of an issue diversity and the Tech gender gap was. Without this diversity in 
                                meetings, there would be opinions left out and overlooked. Thus resulting in designs that potentially 
                                appeal to less than half the population.  
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                This journey of research really changed my mindset on communities and finding a sense of belonging. 
                                Communities aren’t just formed magically, it takes work and effort. And creating these communities 
                                with inclusion and diversity in mind are difficult, but worthwhile to pursue. It also showed me that 
                                I can be a leader of change and I became more confident in standing up for what I believe in as I know 
                                there are dozens of my peers who silently have the same opinions as me.

                            <p>
                                In taking HCDE 210, I met a friend, named Nina, who was deaf. She had an ASL interpreter 
                                with her everyday in class. One time, the interpreter wasn’t there to perform the ASL 
                                translations which she depended on. I didn’t know ASL, but she could read text. So I quickly 
                                started typing everything said in class so she would still be involved. It was a small task for 
                                me, but it meant the world to Nina. It showed me how small things can make a big difference, 
                                especially when it comes to inclusion. 
                            </p><br><p>
                                And taking a step back to view the larger picture, diversity is crucial in having diverse perspectives 
                                to create more holistic solutions. Some of my best projects have come out of working with individuals 
                                who butt heads with me and came from different backgrounds. From working with individuals who have 
                                handicapped issues (including stuttering, blindness, and deafness), I have seen firsthand how much value 
                                they bring to my community. 
                            </p><br><p>
                                When I started planning events for different clubs, I knew providing accessible options was crucial. When 
                                planning a virtual design hackathon for Dubstech, my team and I spent a lot of time on making this event 
                                accessible. We had a wide-reaching net and attracted over 800+ participants from all over the world. Planning 
                                virtual events in the right time zone was difficult and we first directly asked our participants to anonymously 
                                tell us what accessible needs they needed. From their input, we ended up hosting 2 introduction meetings with 
                                closed captioning and screen-reading options to accommodate as many people as we could.

                                The beginning of 2021 was rough for everyone, including myself. Many of us were very much 
                                isolated and overall motivation was low, especially in the design space. The design hackathon 
                                was my way of bringing my community together and rekindling the passion/inspiration many 
                                people lost during the pandemic. I had a little over 5 weeks to plan this event, but I knew 
                                I had to make it amazing as we had reached hundreds of designers, gather. I worked day and 
                                night with my team to plan such an event. 
                            </p><br><p>
                                However, if you asked me this 2 years ago if I would be in the position to lead a hackathon 
                                event, let alone one that had over 800 participants, I’d think you’re joking. I was never one 
                                to take action before becoming into UW and feeling empowered to spread inspiration. The mentors 
                                and professors who I’ve met along the way. This ambition to inspire others was from my past 
                                mentors and experiences at UW. They took me under their wings and provided me with a wealth 
                                of resources and opportunities, it was time I paid it forward. And the least I could do was 
                                create an event to <em>connect designers together.</em>

                            <p>Another important lesson I’ve learned in my courses is curiosity. Curiosity 
                                time and time again has paid off in class and the lessons I’ve learned from 
                                having to go explore topics and design my own projects. Not just stopping at 
                                the core readings, but asking why something works the way it is and developing 
                                my own sources of argument and verification. Sometimes, it is crucial to question 
                                why things are working the way it is. You might have a different perspective and 
                                even though it might not be right, it’ll lead to discussions and potential flaws 
                                of the readings. Nothing is set in stone “the truth”. Facts will always change 
                                and that is the beauty of a university, a space to challenge the things we learn.

                                I participated in a number of UW-hosted hackathons and won a few. Hackathons gave 
                                me an opportunity to be curious within a community of hackers. By bouncing ideas 
                                back and forth with my peers, I was able to grow in my learnings and create clever 
                                solutions for water inefficiencies and remote learning. This aspect of ideating as 
                                well as creating some sort of software was my passion and something that has guided 
                                me to my professional journey of being a software engineer.

                                Landing a role in tech was more than just having the technical components, it was 
                                also about having professional skills.

                            <p> It wasn’t until taking INFO 386, a professionalism class, where I realized how crucial 
                                this skill was. Some might say life-changing because how you uphold yourself is how 
                                others will treat you. And after refining my speaking, writing, and presentation skills, 
                                I saw a complete 180 in how I was able to articulate myself. 
                            </p><br><p>
                                This skill was extremely useful in my Capstone class where I worked with the WA Chamber 
                                of Commerce to create a funding dashboard application for small businesses. Here, I had 
                                numerous meetings with executive-level stakeholders who had various different expectations 
                                on the direction of the project. Managing all these expectations and communicating 
                                technical nuances to non-technical individuals was daunting. Luckily, with the 
                                professionalism skills learned in INFO 386, I was able to impress the project stakeholders 
                                and create a meaningful project.
